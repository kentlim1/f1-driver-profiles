# Formula 1 Driver Profiles

This is a website that displays F1 driver profiles by me as a passion projectâ€”made with TypeScript, React.js, [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS, and HTML.  

I used the [Jolpica F1 API](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/ "Jolpica F1 API") ([GitHub](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1)) to query updated info on driver standings, teams, and championship points.

## TO DO:

- small bio for each driver
- something for backend
- last 5 results?
