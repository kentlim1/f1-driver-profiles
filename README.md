# Formula 1 Driver Profiles

This is a website that displays F1 driver profiles by Kent Lim as a passion projectâ€”made with TypeScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and HTML.  

I used the [Jolpica F1 API](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/ "Jolpica F1 API") ([GitHub Link](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/)) to query updated info on driver standings, teams, and championship points.

## TO DO:
